# Simulate or publish the packages to npmjs.com
#
# Trigger a publication is a manual operation as there is no strong, automated mecanisms to ensure bug minimization.
#
# Publication strategies:
# - simulate: list the operations that would have been done during a publication.
#             These operations are listed in the output of the action.
# - publication: do the operations (versions bumps, updated changelogs and Git tags) in a release branch,
#                then merged it in the main branch once the publication has been done.
