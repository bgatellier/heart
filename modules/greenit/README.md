# Usage

## Standalone

1. Install the package

    ```bash
    npm install @fabernovel/heart-greenit
    ```

    If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install _[Scodi CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

    ```bash
    npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
    ```

2. Start an analysis

    ```bash
    npx heart greenit --config '{"url":"https://www.fabernovel.com/"}'
    ```

    OR 

    ```bash
    npx heart greenit --config config.json
    ```

    The analysis configuration follows the JSON format and has the following keys:

    ```jsonc
    {
        "url": "https://www.fabernovel.com/",
        // optional - default: 3000
        "timeout": 1000,
        // optional - default: 2
        "retry": 2,
        // optional - default: "desktop"
        // possible values: "desktop", "galaxyS9", "galaxyS20", "iPhone8", "iPhone8Plus", "iPhoneX", "iPad"
        "device": "galaxyS20"
    }
    ```
