# Contribute to _Heart Big Query_

If you want to propose new features, bug or security fixes, you have to:
1. Code your stuff in a dedicated branch
2. [Optional] Update the README.md
3. Propose your changes through a _Merge request_

The merging operation will be done by a core team member, once every discussion are resolved and pipelines are successful.
